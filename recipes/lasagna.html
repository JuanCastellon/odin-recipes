            <li>Cook the sausage, ground beef, minced onion,
                and the two cloves of garlic in a Dutch oven 
                over medium heat until well browned.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 
                tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 
                2 tablespoons of parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon of salt, 
                Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, 
                covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Drain noodles, and rinse in cold water.
            </li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta 
                cheese with egg, the remaining 2 tablespoons of 
                parsley, and ½ teaspoon of salt.
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom 
                of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lenghtwise 
                over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with ½ ricotta
