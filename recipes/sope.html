        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups of masa harina (Maseca is fine)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of salt</li>
            <li>2 cups of warm water, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 quart of oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk masa harina and salt together in a bowl. 
                Stir in enough water until dough is smooth and 
                holds together.
            </li>
            <li>Form the dough into twelve 2-inch balls. Place 
                balls onto parchment paper and flatten to Â½ inch thick 
                circles.
            </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large deep fryer or large saucepan 
                to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry a few sopes at a time 
                until lightly browned, about 30 seconds per side. 
                Transfer with tongs to a paper towel-lined plate 
                and let cool just until they can be handled, 2 to 3 
                minutes. Pinch the edges of the sope togeher to form a 
                little boat.
            </li>
            <li>Return sopes to the hot oil and fry until golden 
                and cooked through, 1 to 2 more minutes. Drain 
                on the paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>Add any topping you'd like! We recommend a combination 
                of cooked ground beef, refried beans, guacamole, and cheese!
